# DAC8-Service-Tool
Service tool for T+A D/A converters DAC8 and DAC8DSD - update firmware, control the device via RS232, perform different service tasks

The tool is written in Pascal, using Lazarus IDE v 1.6.

For those only interested in upgrading the firmware of DAC8DSD:
a compiled version of this program can be found in the subfolder /executable.

Please read the documents in the subfolder /related_documents.
Keep in mind that re-flashing a microprocessor (that is what this program does) 
is never free of risk. If anything goes wrong (loss of power, loss of connection) 
this can possibly damage the device to be flashed.
In worst case the device to be flashed could be bricked and will not work any more...

I believe that this program is sufficiently safe but I take no responsibility for any 
risks resulting from using this software.
